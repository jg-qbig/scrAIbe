# AI Coding Agent - A Learning Project

## Introduction
This project contains an AI agent capable of interacting with a file system and executing Python code. It is designed as a learning project to familiarize myself with AI agents and their capabilities, rather than a production-ready coding assistant.

## Capabilities
The AI agent has the following core capabilities within the scope of a specified working directory:

*   **List files and directories:** It can list the contents of any specified directory within the project, providing details like file size and whether an item is a directory.
*   **Read file contents:** It can read and display the content of any file, up to a maximum number of characters.
*   **Execute Python files:** The agent can run Python scripts with optional command-line arguments.
*   **Write or overwrite files:** It can create new files or modify existing ones with specified content.

## Installation
To set up and run the AI agent, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
*   Python 3.8 or higher
*   `pip` or `uv` (recommended for faster dependency resolution)

### Steps
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Wolfingten/ai-agent.git
    cd ai-agent
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    Using `uv`:
    ```bash
    uv venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
    Or using `python -m venv`:
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    Using `uv` (recommended):
    ```bash
    uv install
    ```
    Or using `pip`:
    ```bash
    pip install .
    ```

## Setup

### Environment Variables
API keys and other sensitive information should be stored in a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. A typical `.env` file might look like this:

```dotenv
# Example for a hypothetical API key
GEMINI_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
```

Make sure to replace `your_api_key` with your actual API key.

## Usage
Once installed and set up, the agent can be run using the main entry point (e.g., `main.py`).

### Example Command
To run the AI agent with a specific prompt, use the following command:

```bash
python main.py "List all .py files in the current directory and their sizes."
```
This command will execute the AI agent with the prompt "List all .py files in the current directory and their sizes.", demonstrating how to interact with the agent directly from the command line.
